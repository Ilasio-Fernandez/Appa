# Appa
A beginner programmer on the self-taught path, just like all of you at some point the struggle is real and i'm just trying to progress in the most efficient way possible. I am open to any criticism, advice or mentorship . I wish all of you good luck on your journey no matter what step you are at  and have a good day!
